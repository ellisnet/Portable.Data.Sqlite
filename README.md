Portable.Data.Sqlite====================This is a portable cross-platform ADO provider for SQLite databases, featuring table-column-level and table-record-level data encryption.  It is intended to be a Portable Class Library (PCL) that does the following:  1. Works properly on the following platforms:    * Windows desktop (with .NET Framework 4.5 or higher)    * Windows Runtime (a.k.a. Windows Store) 8 and higher    * Windows Phone 8 and higher    * Xamarin.iOS    * Xamarin.Android  2. Runs on top of (and requires) the Portable Class Library for SQLite (SQLitePCL) from MSOpenTech - info available [here](http://sqlitepcl.codeplex.com/) - NuGet package available [here](http://www.nuget.org/packages/SQLitePCL)  3. Provides access to SQLite databases via the native built-into-the-operating-system implementations of SQLite for the platforms listed above (where an implementation exists).  4. Provides a PCL-based ADO-style way of interacting with SQLite databases - based on the Mono.Data.Sqlite implementation available [here](https://github.com/mattleibow/Mono.Data.Sqlite)  5. Enables **easy table record-level and column-level encryption of data** in your SQLite database.Important Notes About Encryption:---------------------------------  1. For various reasons, this library **does not include** an encryption algorithm.  You provide the algorithm by implementing the *IObjectCryptEngine* interface.  This allows you to choose exactly how your data will be encrypted.  Taking a solid encryption algorithm and implementing your own *encryption engine* should be pretty easy; see detailed information below.  2. This library **does not implement full database encryption** - for that, please investigate SQLCipher - available [here](http://sqlcipher.net/)  As the developer who is using this library, you decide which data in the database to encrypt; and which data not to.  You can encrypt any column in any table, and you can encrypt an entire table (i.e. all of the records in a table).The Difficult Parts Up Front:-----------------------------So let's just get straight to the potentially difficult parts.  They are:  1. It may be difficult to set up SQLitePCL (i.e. the Portable Class Library for SQLite mentioned above) if you are developing for a platform that doesn't come with SQLite built-in - like Windows (desktop) or Windows Store.  You have to install an add-on for Visual Studio and/or download a .DLL or two.  But there is excellent information available on the SQLitePCL CodePlex site - [documentation here](https://sqlitepcl.codeplex.com/documentation)  Note that there is also an extra step needed for Xamarin.iOS, where you initialize/load SQLitePCL.Ext.dll by calling SQLitePCL.CurrentPlatform.Init()  2. Implementing your chosen encryption algorithm, by creating a class that implements *Portable.Data.Sqlite.IObjectCryptEngine* - You will need to create a class that has Encrypt() and Decrypt&lt;T&gt;() methods.  Encrypt() will take just about any CLR Object and will serialize it and encrypt it, and then return the byte-array as a string; Decrypt&lt;T&gt;() will take a byte-array-as-a-string, decrypt it and de-serialize it back to an object of the type specified as &lt;T&gt;.  So, Decrypt&lt;MyObject&gt;(myEncryptedString) should decrypt myEncryptedString and turn it into a MyObject-class object and return it.  I have found that using the popular JSON.NET library (from [here](http://www.newtonsoft.com) ) works great for the serializing and de-serializing part.So, here is an example of how you *could* implement *IObjectCryptEngine* - using AES encryption that comes built into the OS on all supported platforms.  The following code should provide reasonable data encryption/security, but has a few issues as described in the comments:```c#using System;using System.Security.Cryptography;using System.Text;using Newtonsoft.Json;using Portable.Data.Sqlite;//Example AES-based "crypt engine" for use with Portable.Data.Sqlite,//  should work on all platforms supported by Portable.Data.Sqlite.//Disclaimer://  THIS SAMPLE CODE IS BEING PROVIDED FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY, AND//  IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE WITH SOFTWARE THAT MUST PROVIDE ACTUAL DATA SECURITY.//  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR //  IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, //  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
