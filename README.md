Please read this important note!
================================

This library - *Portable.Data.Sqlite* - is being replaced by my **SimpleAdo.Sqlite** library ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ellisnet/SimpleAdo) - [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimpleAdo.Sqlite/)).

The **good** news:

  * The new library - **SimpleAdo.Sqlite** - contains pretty much all of the functionality of *Portable.Data.Sqlite* - with one significant exception: the `EncryptedTable<T>` functionality has not been ported.  And everything pretty much works the same way, so other than the `EncryptedTable<T>` functionality, it should *almost* be a drop-in replacement for *Portable.Data.Sqlite*.
  * The new library is not implemented as a Portable Class Library (PCL) - it is a .NET Standard 1.1 library. So that should allow it to be supported and supportable for years and years, in the Microsoft .NET and Xamarin eco-system. *(Sidenote: you may think 'Yeah, but we are already up to .NET Standard 2.0, aren't you going to keep up?' Well, that isn't how things work in the .NET Standard world - for maximum compatibility, I want to comply with as low of a .NET Standard version as possible. If I can stick with .NET Standard 1.1, it should be automatically compatible with all versions that come after.)*
  * The new library is based on a more stable and widely-used open-source cross-platform SQLite provider library - [SQLitePCL.raw](https://github.com/ericsink/SQLitePCL.raw) - which used by other major SQLite libraries like [SQLite-net](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) and Microsoft's own [Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SQLite/) and [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite/). Should be very stable long-term. *Portable.Data.Sqlite* is based on a Microsoft Open library - [SQLitePCL](https://sqlitepcl.codeplex.com/) - that appears to be abandoned.
  * There **is** a new version of *Portable.Data.Sqlite* that removes the dependency on the **SQLitePCL** library, and has been tested with Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android (pre-Nougat and post-Nougat), UWP and .NET 4.5. From my testing, it appears to work great. It is available in the *develop* branch of this repository - [available here](https://github.com/ellisnet/Portable.Data.Sqlite/tree/develop).  Check out the *Samples* folder in the *develop* branch for code samples of how to use it in those platforms.

The **bad** news:

  * This project - *Portable.Data.Sqlite* - will hereby be abandoned until further notice; I do not plan to fix bugs or provide any other updates. My attention will be devoted to **SimpleAdo.Sqlite** and other exciting projects.
  * As mentioned above, the new **SimpleAdo.Sqlite** library does not include the `EncryptedTable<T>` functionality. I am not getting rid of that functionality - I worked hard on it - but I am moving it to a different library that I am currently working on.  All of the code in [this folder](https://github.com/ellisnet/Portable.Data.Sqlite/tree/develop/Portable.Data.Sqlite/EncryptedTable) should work great with **SimpleAdo.Sqlite** - by just fixing some namespaces; if you just want to pull that into your own project.  Or, use the *Portable.Data.Sqlite* [*develop* branch](https://github.com/ellisnet/Portable.Data.Sqlite/tree/develop) code and build your own libraries with this functionality.
  * Also, the new library doesn't have the `IDatabasePath` interface built-in, so just copy [this](https://github.com/ellisnet/Portable.Data.Sqlite/blob/master/Portable.Data.Sqlite/IDatabasePath.cs) interface into your own project, if needed.  The use of this interface is explained well in the documentation for **SimpleAdo.Sqlite**.
  * One other change to be aware of: the constructors for `SqliteConnection` are different between *Portable.Data.Sqlite* and **SimpleAdo.Sqlite**. This was necessary because of the switch away from *SQLitePCL* (and is also true in the *develop* branch of this library). Just read the docs and XML comments about how to create an instance of `SqliteConnection`; it's pretty easy.
  * Finally, as of November 2017, I don't plan to update the *Portable.Data.Sqlite* [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Portable.Data.Sqlite/) beyond version 1.1.2. Specifically, I don't plan to produce a new NuGet package based on the *develop* branch code; because that would just be confusing, when I really want people to move to **SimpleAdo.Sqlite**. But my mind could be changed on that decision, if me creating an updated NuGet package of *Portable.Data.Sqlite* would be really helpful to somebody.

Portable.Data.Sqlite
====================

This is a portable cross-platform ADO provider for SQLite databases, featuring table-column-level and table-record-level data encryption.  It is intended to be a Portable Class Library (PCL) that does the following:

  1. Works properly on the following platforms:
    * Windows desktop (with .NET Framework 4.5 or higher)
    * Windows Runtime (a.k.a. Windows Store) 8 and higher
    * Windows Phone 8 and higher
    * Xamarin.iOS
    * Xamarin.Android
  2. Runs on top of (and requires) the Portable Class Library for SQLite (SQLitePCL) from MSOpenTech - info available [here](http://sqlitepcl.codeplex.com/) - NuGet package available [here](http://www.nuget.org/packages/SQLitePCL)
  3. Provides access to SQLite databases via the native built-into-the-operating-system implementations of SQLite for the platforms listed above (where an implementation exists).
  4. Provides a PCL-based ADO-style way of interacting with SQLite databases; based on a portable (PCL) implementation of Mono.Data.Sqlite that was adapted by Matthew Leibowitz (@mattleibow) - available [here](https://github.com/mattleibow/Mono.Data.Sqlite)
  5. Enables **easy table record-level and column-level encryption of data** in your SQLite database.

Was previously: The developer of this library welcomes all feedback, suggestions, issue/bug reports, and pull requests. Please log questions and issues in the Portable.Data.Sqlite GitHub *Issues* section - available here.

Now: Not really, see above.

The latest released version of this library is available via NuGet. From within Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio, search for **Portable.Data.Sqlite**

Important Notes About Encryption
--------------------------------
  1. For various reasons, this library **does not include an encryption algorithm**.  All operating systems listed above have built-in AES encryption that can be used with this library (as one example of an encryption algorithm that works well).  It is up to you to specify the algorithm to use by implementing the *IObjectCryptEngine* interface.  This allows you to choose exactly how your data will be encrypted.  Taking a well understood encryption algorithm and implementing your own *encryption engine* should not be too difficult; see detailed information below.
  2. This library **does not implement full database encryption** - for that, please investigate SQLCipher - available [here](http://sqlcipher.net/)  
It is up to you - the developer who is using this library - to decide which data in the database to encrypt; and which data not to.  You can encrypt any column in any table, and you can encrypt an entire table (i.e. all of the records in a table).

Dealing with the (Potentially) Difficult Parts Up Front
-------------------------------------------------------
So let's just get straight to the potentially difficult parts.  They are:

  1. It may be difficult to set up SQLitePCL (i.e. the Portable Class Library for SQLite mentioned above) if you are developing for a platform that doesn't come with SQLite built-in - like Windows (desktop) or Windows Store.  You have to install an add-on for Visual Studio and/or download a .DLL or two.  But there is excellent information available on the SQLitePCL CodePlex site - [documentation here](https://sqlitepcl.codeplex.com/documentation)  
Note that there is also an extra step needed for Xamarin.iOS, where you initialize/load SQLitePCL.Ext.dll by calling *SQLitePCL.CurrentPlatform.Init()*
  2. You need to implement your chosen encryption algorithm, by creating a class that implements *Portable.Data.Sqlite.IObjectCryptEngine* - You will need to create a class that has EncryptObject() and DecryptObject&lt;T&gt;() methods.  EncryptObject() will take just about any CLR Object and will serialize it and encrypt it, and then return the byte-array as a string; DecryptObject&lt;T&gt;() will take a byte-array-as-a-string, decrypt it and de-serialize it back to an object of the type specified as &lt;T&gt;.  So, DecryptObject&lt;MyObject&gt;(myEncryptedString) should decrypt myEncryptedString and turn it into a MyObject-class object and return it.  I have found that using the popular JSON.NET library (from [here](http://www.newtonsoft.com) ) works great for the serializing and de-serializing part.  Also, if you are looking for a PCL-based library with a bunch of encryption algorithms, take a look at Bouncy Castle PCL (Portable.BouncyCastle) - available on NuGet [here](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Portable.BouncyCastle)
  
As of version 1.1 of the library, an *Initialize()* method is also required by the *IObjectCryptEngine* interface - as shown in the example code below. This was done to allow for the use of a parameterless constructor, as required by Xamarin.Forms.  In the example below, it is used to set the crypto key (a.k.a. password) of the encryption; but since its parameter is a dictionary of objects, you could really use to pass in any number of parameters required by your crypt engine.  You could also implement it as an empty method, and create the constructors (and other methods) that you want for initializing your crypt engine.

So, here is an example of how you *could* implement *IObjectCryptEngine* - using AES encryption that comes built into the OS on all supported platforms.  The following code should provide reasonable data encryption/security, but has a few issues as described in the comments:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using Portable.Data.Sqlite;

    string _cryptoKey;
    Aes _aesProvider;
    bool _initialized = false;

    private byte[] getBytes(string text, int requiredLength) {
        var result = new byte[requiredLength];
        byte[] textBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(text);
        int offset = 0;
        while (offset < requiredLength) {
            int toCopy = (requiredLength >= (offset + textBytes.Length)) ?
                textBytes.Length : requiredLength - offset;
            Buffer.BlockCopy(textBytes, 0, result, offset, toCopy);
            offset += toCopy;
        }
        return result;
    }

    public SimpleAesCryptEngine() { }

    public SimpleAesCryptEngine(string cryptoKey) {
        this.Initialize(new Dictionary<string, object>() { { "CryptoKey", cryptoKey } });
    }

    public void Initialize(Dictionary<string, object> cryptoParams) {
        _cryptoKey = cryptoParams["CryptoKey"].ToString();
        _aesProvider = Aes.Create();
        _aesProvider.Key = getBytes(_cryptoKey, _aesProvider.Key.Length);
        //Here we are using the same value for all initialization vectors.
        //  This is NOT RECOMMENDED - it should be randomly generated;
        //  however, then you need a way to retrieve it for decryption.
        //  More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector
        _aesProvider.IV = getBytes("THIS SHOULD BE RANDOM", _aesProvider.IV.Length);
        _initialized = true;
    }

    public T DecryptObject<T>(string stringToDecrypt) {

        T result = default(T);
        if (stringToDecrypt != null) {
            byte[] bytesToDecrypt = Convert.FromBase64String(stringToDecrypt);
            byte[] decryptedBytes =
                _aesProvider.CreateDecryptor().TransformFinalBlock(bytesToDecrypt, 0, bytesToDecrypt.Length);
            result =
                JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(decryptedBytes));
        }
        return result;
    }

            byte[] bytesToEncrypt =
                Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(objectToEncrypt));
            //Not sure if I should be using TransformFinalBlock() here, 
            //  or if it is more secure if I break the byte array into
            //  blocks and process one block at a time.
            byte[] encryptedBytes =
                _aesProvider.CreateEncryptor().TransformFinalBlock(bytesToEncrypt, 0, bytesToEncrypt.Length);
            result = Convert.ToBase64String(encryptedBytes);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public void Dispose() {
        _cryptoKey = null;
        if (_aesProvider != null) { _aesProvider.Dispose(); }
        _aesProvider = null;
    }
}
```

Explanation of Sample Projects
------------------------------
In the Samples folder of this repository you will find the folders listed below, with samples for each of the supported platforms:  Windows desktop (with .NET Framework 4.5 or higher); Windows Runtime (a.k.a. Windows Store) 8 and higher; Windows Phone 8 and higher (sample coming soon); Xamarin.iOS; and Xamarin.Android.

These are no-frills *File - New Project* projects where I added some code to the initial "Window/Page/Activity/ViewController" Load event to create a SQLite database, and then create (and manipulate) some tables and records in it.  There is nothing to see in the UI - to check things out, you should read the code and then see what is happening in the Output window of your IDE when you run the application in Debug configuration.

If you want to see exactly what code I added to each *File - New Project* for demonstrating SQLite functionality, search for *ADDED TO SAMPLE TO DEMONSTRATE Portable.Data.Sqlite*.  Any code that I added to the automatically generated project files is tagged with that comment.

Samples sub-folders:
  * SqliteSampleCode - code that is shared (via file linking) by all projects, includes a class - *SampleDataItem* - with detailed comments about how to create an object for use with EncryptedTable&lt;T&gt;
  * SampleApp.Wpf - a sample project for Windows desktop (WPF) with .NET Framework 4.5 or higher. Most of the sample code is in *MainWindow.xaml.cs*, with some application-level stuff in the *App.xaml.cs* file. I find this one to be the most helpful for development/testing, because it is easy for me to examine the SQLite database file using Navicat for SQLite, and see what is happening in the database.  Navicat for SQLite is available [here](http://www.navicat.com/products/navicat-for-sqlite) - there is also an excellent free SQLite database tool available [here](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)
  * SampleApp.Android - a sample project for use with Xamarin.Android, with the sample code in *Main.Activity.cs*
  * SampleApp.iOS - a sample project for use with Xamarin.iOS, with the sample code in *SampleApp.iOSViewController.cs*, and some application-level code in *AppDelegate.cs*
  * SampleApp.WinStore - a sample project for use with Windows 8.1 and higher (i.e. a "metro"-style app). Most of the sample code is in *MainPage.xaml.cs*, with some application-level stuff in the *App.xaml.cs* file.
  * SampleApp.WinPhone - (COMING SOON) a sample project for use with Windows Phone 8 and higher

Examples Part 1: Doing ADO Stuff
--------------------------------
Note: This library doesn't have a "full" implementation of ADO.NET as you might be used to with Microsoft SQL Server (System.Data.SqlClient).  This is partly due to limitations of the versions of SQLite that ship with mobile devices, partly due to limitations of the SQLitePCL library, and partly... well... things just haven't been implemented and/or tested yet.  There is some code relating to Transactions for example (Portable.Data.Transactions) that may do some things, but I have ignored this and have done **zero testing** with it.  Mainly, I stick to using DbConnections (i.e. SqliteAdoConnection), DbCommands (i.e. SqliteCommand) and DbDataReaders (i.e. SqliteDataReader).  Those are all you need for most SQLite operations.

Step 1) Opening a connection to our database (database file will be created if it doesn't exist), creating a table and adding/reading (i.e. INSERTing/SELECTing) a record.

```c#
//using Portable.Data.Sqlite;

string sql;
string databasePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(pathToDatabaseFolder, "mydatabase.sqlite");
using (IObjectCryptEngine myCryptEngine = new MyCryptEngine("my encryption password")) 
{
    using (var myConnection = new SqliteAdoConnection(
        new SQLitePCL.SQLiteConnection(databasePath), myCryptEngine)) 
    {
        sql = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS [myTableName] " 
            + "(Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, FirstWord TEXT, SecondWord TEXT);";
        using (var myCommand = new SqliteCommand(sql, myConnection)) 
		{
            myConnection.SafeOpen(); //myConnection.SafeOpen() is the same as 
                //  myConnection.Open() - but doesn't throw an exception if the connection
                //  is already open.
            myCommand.ExecuteNonQuery();
        }
		//NOTE: All of the other example SQL in this section - Part 1: ADO stuff - goes here
    }
}
```
Here is what the above code does:

We identified a new SQLite database [file] called *mydatabase.sqlite* in the folder specified in *pathToDatabaseFolder*.  The recommended folder varies based on the platform (Windows Store, iOS, Android, etc.)  I will probably add a list of the recommended folder paths for each platform here; but at the moment, I haven't verified those.  You can look at the examples in the Samples folder to see which folders they are using.

Next we created an instance of *MyCryptEngine* which is our implementation of *IObjectCryptEngine* as described above, with our secret password.

Next we created an instance of *SqliteAdoConnection* based on a *SQLitePCL.SQLiteConnection* to our database [file]; and we passed in our crypt engine. Creating the new *SQLitePCL.SQLiteConnection*, with the path to our file, created our database file if it didn't already exist.

The *sql = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS..."* line is our SQL statement to create our new table.  Using the *SqliteCommand.ExecuteNonQuery()* line, we can send pretty much any SQLite-legal SQL statements to our database.  Note that SQLite SQL is not the same as the T-SQL that you use with Microsoft's SQL products.  For example - as you will see below - instead of *SELECT TOP 1 * FROM myTableName* (T-SQL), we will use *SELECT * FROM myTableName LIMIT 1* (SQLite SQL).  Lots of information about SQLite's flavor of SQL is available [here](http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html)

Finally, we create a *SqliteCommand* with our SQL statement and connection, open the database connection and execute it.

```c#
        //Add/insert a record
        sql = "INSERT INTO [myTableName] (FirstWord, SecondWord) " +
            "VALUES (@firstword, @secondword);";
        int newRowId;
        using (var myCommand = new SqliteCommand(sql, myConnection)) 
        {
            myCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter("@firstword", "Hello"));
            myCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter("@secondword", "SQLite"));
            myConnection.SafeOpen();
            newRowId = (int)myCommand.ExecuteReturnRowId();
        }

        //Select a record
        sql = "SELECT * FROM [myTableName] WHERE [Id] = @rowid;";
        using (var myCommand = new SqliteCommand(sql, myConnection)) 
        {
            myCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter("@rowid", value: newRowId));
            myConnection.SafeOpen();
            using (SqliteDataReader myReader = myCommand.ExecuteReader()) 
            {
                while (myReader.Read()) 
                {
                    int rowId = myReader.GetInt32("Id");
                    string firstWord = myReader["FirstWord"].ToString() ?? "";
                    string lastWord = myReader.GetString("SecondWord") ?? "";
                    Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}!",  firstWord, lastWord); // Output: Hello SQLite!
                }
            }
        }

        //Select the 'TOP 1' record - via 'LIMIT 1'
        sql = "SELECT [Id] FROM [myTableName] ORDER BY [Id] DESC LIMIT 1;";
        using (var myCommand = new SqliteCommand(sql, myConnection)) 
        {
            myConnection.SafeOpen();
            int highestRowId = Convert.ToInt32(myCommand.ExecuteScalar());
            Console.WriteLine("The highest [Id] column value so far is: {0}", highestRowId);
        }
```
Here is what the above code does:

First we INSERTed a row into our table with the values ('*Hello*', '*SQLite*').  We used *SQLiteCommand.ExecuteReturnRowId()* so we would get back the RowId (i.e. the value of our INTEGER PRIMARY KEY [Id] column). Note that SQLite mostly deals in the long/Int64 datatype for Integer values, so that is what *SQLiteCommand.ExecuteReturnRowId()* returned, and we cast it as an int/Int32.

Next we SELECTed the row using *SqliteCommand.ExecuteReader()* to create a *SqliteDataReader*, and then *SqliteDataReader.Read()* to iterate through the rows of our recordset.  If more than row had been returned, the *while (myReader.Read()) {}* loop would repeat for each row - i.e. *SqliteDataReader.Read()* returns false when there are no more rows. Notice that when doing *SqliteDataReader.Read()*, there a few different ways to get a particular column value.  You can use *SqliteDataReader[columnName]* or *SqliteDataReader[columnIndex]*, which return *System.Object*; or you can use *SqliteDataReader.GetXXX(columnName)* or *SqliteDataReader.GetXXX(columnIndex)* to get a value of a particular type (e.g. *SqliteDataReader.GetInt32()* or *SqliteDataReader.GetString()* as shown above).

Finally, we used *SqliteCommand.ExecuteScalar()* to get a single value. It returns the value of the first column of the first returned row. But *SqliteCommand.ExecuteScalar()* just returns a *System.Object*; it doesn't know what datatype it is returning, so we had to convert that into an Integer.

Believe it or not, you can do almost everything you could want in your SQLite database with just the above code - and some knowledge of the [SQLite flavor of SQL](http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html).

Step 2) Working with an encrypted column.

```c#
        //Adding the encrypted column
        sql = "ALTER TABLE [myTableName] ADD COLUMN EncryptedColumn ENCRYPTED;";
        myConnection.SafeOpen();
        (new SqliteCommand(sql, myConnection)).ExecuteNonQuery();

        //Adding some encrypted values
        string valueToEncrypt1 = "This string will be encrypted in the database.";
        Tuple<int, string, string> valueToEncrypt2  = 
            Tuple.Create(1, "This object will also", "be encrypted.");
        long encryptedRowId1, encryptedRowId2;
        sql = "INSERT INTO [myTableName] (EncryptedColumn) VALUES (@encrypted);";
        //add value #1
        using (var myCommand = new SqliteCommand(sql, myConnection)) 
        {
            myCommand.AddEncryptedParameter(new SqliteParameter("@encrypted", valueToEncrypt1));
            myConnection.SafeOpen();
            encryptedRowId1 = myCommand.ExecuteReturnRowId();
        }
        //add value #2
        using (var myCommand = new SqliteCommand(sql, myConnection)) 
        {
            myCommand.AddEncryptedParameter(new SqliteParameter("@encrypted", valueToEncrypt2));
            myConnection.SafeOpen();
            encryptedRowId2 = myCommand.ExecuteReturnRowId();
        }

        //Check the encrypted values
        sql = "SELECT [EncryptedColumn] FROM [myTableName] WHERE [Id] = @rowid;";
        //get value #1
        using (var myCommand = new SqliteCommand(sql, myConnection)) 
        {
            myCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter("@rowid", value: encryptedRowId1));
            myConnection.SafeOpen();
            using (SqliteDataReader myReader = myCommand.ExecuteReader()) 
            {
                while (myReader.Read()) 
                {
                    string encryptedValue = myReader.GetString("EncryptedColumn");
                    //Note: By default, GetDecrypted<T> will throw an exception if a NULL column value is encountered.
                    //  You can change this behavior by specifying DbNullHandling.ReturnTypeDefaultValue instead - this will
                    //  return the default value - as in default(T) - of the type specified as T.  'null' in the case of a string
                    string decryptedValue = myReader.GetDecrypted<string>("EncryptedColumn", dbNullHandling: DbNullHandling.ReturnTypeDefaultValue);
                    Console.WriteLine("The encrypted value is: " + encryptedValue);
                    //Output: The encrypted value is: (random characters)
                    Console.WriteLine("The decrypted value is: " + decryptedValue);
                    //Output: The decrypted value is: This string will be encrypted in the database.
                }
            }
        }
        //get value #2
        using (var myCommand = new SqliteCommand(sql, myConnection)) 
        {
            myCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter("@rowid", value: encryptedRowId2));
            myConnection.SafeOpen();
            Tuple<int, string, string> decryptedValue = myCommand.ExecuteDecrypt<Tuple<int, string, string>>();
            Console.WriteLine("The decrypted value is: {0} - {1} {2}",
                decryptedValue.Item1, decryptedValue.Item2, decryptedValue.Item3);
            //Output: The decrypted value is: 1 - This object will also be encrypted.
        }
```
Here is what the above code does:

First we added an *EncryptedColumn* column to our table.  We set the datatype for the column to be *ENCRYPTED*, but that is just for show.  It really is *TEXT* - there is no such thing in SQLite as a column of datatype *ENCRYPTED*.  However, I like to do that, in case I look at the table column list - it helps me to know which columns are encrypted.  Note that if this SQL statement was executed again, we would get an exception because the column has already been added to the table, and we can't add it again.  There is a *CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS* but not an *ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS*, but we could have added this column in our original table definition and avoided this problem.  The code in the sample applications get around this problem by performing a *PRAGMA* command to get a list of columns, and then determine if the column existed or not.

We added our values-to-be-encrypted using *SqliteParameter* almost as normal, but the parameter values were added with *SqliteCommand.AddEncryptedParameter(new SqliteParameter(columnName, valueToEncrypt))* - that is the only thing special we had to do.

Then, we got our decrypted value back, by using a *SqliteDataReader* just as before; but we used *SqliteDataReader.GetDecrypted&lt;T&gt;(columnName)*.  Note that, by default, this will cause an exception if the value in the table column is NULL, though there is an optional *DbNullHandling* enum parameter to control that behavior.  You can also use the *SqliteDataReader.TryDecrypt&lt;T&gt;()* method that will just return a false if the decryption couldn't happen (e.g. if the column value was NULL).

For our second decrypted value, we used the *SqliteCommand.ExecuteDecrypt&lt;T&gt;()* method.  This works just like *SqliteCommand.ExecuteScalar()* - discussed above - but will return a decrypted value from the first column of the first row of the recordset returned by the query.

Important Final Notes for ADO:

  1. We were able to store an object (a Tuple, in the above example) - not just a string or integer value - in an encrypted column, because SQLite doesn't really care what we put in there.  It will all be text, as far as SQLite is concerned. We could basically put just about any type of CLR object in an encrypted column... which is pretty powerful.
  2. However searching for matching records based on values in an encrypted column becomes difficult, because you would have to search on an exact encrypted string; or decrypt all of the values in your table to see which records had a matching value.  That is the reason for Part 2: EncryptedTable&lt;T&gt; - so keep reading...

Examples Part 2: Using EncryptedTable&lt;T&gt;
----------------------------------------

Note: Creating an "encrypted table" means creating a table where the data for all of the records are encrypted.  To SQLite, the table will look/and work as normal - SQLite won't be able to tell that there is anything different about it - but all of the data will be contained in an *ENCRYPTED* (really a *TEXT*) field called *[Encrypted_Object]*.  The main exception is the *PRIMARY KEY INTEGER* column named *[Id]*.  Every encrypted table will have this *[Id]* column and it cannot be changed; also, you cannot use another field or property as the primary key.

It is possible to store other non-encrypted data in the table, to make querying a bit easier.  As you will see below, these column properties must specifically labled *[NotEncrypted]*.

SO, ALL DATA ADDED TO AN ENCRYPTED TABLE WILL BE FULLY ENCRYPTED IN THE DATABASE - EXCEPT THE *[Id]* (integer) COLUMN, AND ANY COLUMNS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY MARKED *[NotEncrypted]*.

Step 1) Creating an object for use with our encrypted table.

```c#
using Portable.Data.Sqlite;

public class ProtectedData : EncryptedTableItem {

    private string _lastName;
    private string _firstName;

    public string LastName {
        get { return _lastName; }
        set { _lastName = SetChanged(value); }
    }

    public string FirstName {
        get { return _firstName; }
        set { _firstName = SetChanged(value); }
    }

    //Note that the other properties we will add in Step 1 will go here

}
```

The class shown above is almost a "plain old CLR object", or POCO, with just two properties for first and last name. It is pretty unremarkable as C# classes go.  But it has a couple of critical additions - it inherits from *EncryptedTableItem*, and the property setters are using *SetChanged()*.  Inheriting from *EncryptedTableItem* is the most important thing, and allows us to create a Encrypted Table based on this object.  However, if we leave it as is, we will have a problem with searching the table.  Because the first and last names will be encrypted, and we won't be able to do something like: *SELECT FirstName FROM [ProtectedData] WHERE LastName = 'Johnson';* - our code would have to get the entire table contents, decrypt each record and then find the matching records.  But we don't want to lose our encryption of the first and last name; so, we will just make one tweak:

```c#
    private string _lastName;
    private string _firstName;

    [Searchable]
    public string LastName {
        get { return _lastName; }
        set { _lastName = SetChanged(value); }
    }

    [Searchable]
    public string FirstName {
        get { return _firstName; }
        set { _firstName = SetChanged(value); }
    }
```

By adding the *[Searchable]* attribute on our FirstName and LastName properties, we made them searchable without the need to decrypt the entire table.  When these records are saved to the database, an encrypted "index" will also be saved, with just the values of the *[Searchable]* properties.  Note that we could add very complex properties to our object-to-be-stored-in-an-encrypted-table - like a *List&lt;OtherObject&gt;* - and these will be stored correctly with encryption in the database, but these cannot be made searchable.  Only simple properties like string, integer, etc. can be set as *[Searchable]*.

The *SetChanged&lt;T&gt;()* method used above makes sure that if one of the properties is changed, the object will be marked as 'Modified' - with respect to the database record.  Then when *WriteItemChanges()* (see below) is called, the records for these items will be updated in the database.  The *CheckChange&lt;T&gt;* method below is slightly different than *SetChanged&lt;T&gt;()* - *SetChanged&lt;T&gt;()* will always set the object to a status of 'Modified' when the setter for the property is called.  With *CheckChange&lt;T&gt;*, the object will only be marked as 'Modified' if the incoming value is different than the current value.

```c#
    string _stateAbbreviation;
    string _zipCode;

    [NotEncrypted, ColumnName("State"), NotNull, ColumnDefaultValue("MN")]
    public string StateAbbreviation {
        get { return _stateAbbreviation; }
        set { _stateAbbreviation = CheckChange( _stateAbbreviation, value); }
    }

    [NotEncrypted]
    public string ZipCode {
        get { return _zipCode; }
        set { _zipCode = CheckChange( _zipCode, value); }
    }
```

Next, we have added a couple of extra properties to our *ProtectedData* class - and marked them as *[NotEncrypted]*. As mentioned above, this means that this data will **NOT BE ENCRYPTED** in the database.  This data will be stored "in the clear" and accessible by anyone who gets access to our database file.  In the case above, we have decided that the State and ZipCode information does not need to be protected.  The advantage of properties that are marked *[NotEncrypted]* is that searches of these columns in the database table will be particularly fast, since nothing needs to be decrypted in order for these values to be searched. The *StateAbbreviation* property is also marked with some other attributes that will be used when the table column for this property is created in the database - the table column will be named *[State]*, instead of the default (*[StateAbbreviation]* to match the property name).  It will be set to *NOT NULL* (the column cannot contain null values) and it will have a column default value of 'MN'.

```c#
    private List<Address> _knownStreetAddresses;
    public List<Address> KnownStreetAddresses {
        get { return _knownStreetAddresses; }
        set { _knownStreetAddresses = SetChanged(value); }
    }
```  

Finally, we have added a collection of "known street addresses"; this complex type will be encrypted, but will not be searchable.

Step 2) Creating our table and adding some records.

```c#
string databasePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(pathToDatabaseFolder, "mydatabase.sqlite");
using (IObjectCryptEngine myCryptEngine = new MyCryptEngine("my encryption password")) 
{
    using (var myConnection = new SqliteAdoConnection(
        new SQLitePCL.SQLiteConnection(databasePath), myCryptEngine)) 
    {
        using (var myEncryptedTable = new EncryptedTable<ProtectedData>(myCryptEngine,
            myConnection, checkDbTable: true)) 
        {
            myEncryptedTable.AddItem(new ProtectedData {
                FirstName = "Bob",
                LastName = "Fredericks",
                StateAbbreviation = "IA",
                ZipCode = "56789"
            }, immediateWriteToTable: true);

            myEncryptedTable.AddItem(new ProtectedData {
                FirstName = "Linda",
                LastName = "Fredericks",
                StateAbbreviation = "IA",
                ZipCode = "56789"
            }, immediateWriteToTable: false);

            //myEncryptedTable.WriteItemChanges();
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, we identified the path to our SQLite database file, created an instance of our crypt engine, and an ADO connection to our database. These are all identical to what we did in Part 1, see above for an explanation of these steps.

Then we defined our *EncryptedTable* object.  Note that this did not necessarily create a new table in our database.  If the *[ProtectedData]* table already existed, it will just continue to use that one (there is an option to create another table for *ProtectedData* objects - with a different table name - but this is generally not needed or recommended.  When defining our *EncryptedTable* object, we set the *checkDbTable* parameter to true, to make sure it got created (if the table didn't already exist) immediately. This is generally not necessary.

Then we created two new items to be stored using encryption in our table.  For the first one - Bob Fredericks - we identified that it should be immediately written to the database table using *immediateWriteToTable: true*.  For the second item, we did not require it to be written immediately.  This means that it will be held in memory - in the *myEncryptedTable.TempItems* collection - until the *WriteItemChanges()* method is called. This method is **automatically called** when the *EncryptedTable* object is disposed - at the end of the *using(var myEncryptedTable...) {...}* code block.  So, we didn't actually need to include a call to *WriteItemChanges()*, which is why it is commented out.

```c#
using (var myEncryptedTable = new EncryptedTable<ProtectedData>(myCryptEngine, myConnection)) {
    List<ProtectedData> matchingItems = myEncryptedTable.GetItems(new TableSearch {
        SearchType = TableSearchType.MatchAll,  //Items must match all search criteria
        MatchItems = {
            new TableSearchItem("LastName", "Fredericks", SearchItemMatchType.IsEqualTo),
            new TableSearchItem("ZipCode", "56789", SearchItemMatchType.IsEqualTo),
            new TableSearchItem("FirstName", "Bob", SearchItemMatchType.DoesNotContain)
        }
    });

    myEncryptedTable.RemoveItem(matchingItems.First().Id);
    myEncryptedTable.WriteItemChanges();
}
```

Next we queried our table using the *GetItems()* method, which required us to pass in a *TableSearch* object.  Table searches can be *MatchAll* or *MatchAny* and can have zero or many search criteria *MatchItems* - where you are identifying a particular value that you do or do not want in a property value.  You can also identify whether a property is NULL or not.  *GetItems()* looks for a list of items that match the criteria you have specified, and then returns a collection of the matching items.

Finally, we removed one of the items from our table.  As usual, the change did not actually get written to the table until the *WriteItemChanges()* method was called.

Behind the scenes, an index of the items in the table is maintained, so that searching for items in the table - especially using the properties marked *[Searchable]* - does not require the encrypted indexes of the various records to be constantly re-decrypted.  This functionality is pretty powerful, and is available for you to query directly using the *FullTableIndex* property.  Not every method and property of the *EncryptedTable&lt;T&gt;* object has been explained in detail in these examples, but hopefully you have a good foundation to explore.  Also, you are encouraged to leave questions or comments or problem reports in the *Issues* section of this GitHub repository.

How to Use this Library with Xamarin.Forms
------------------------------------------
As of version 1.1 of this library, using it with Xamarin.Forms is easy.  I will also be providing information about using with a "Shared Code" Xamarin.Forms project in the future (it easier than with a "Portable Library" Xamarin.Forms project); but for now here are the changes needed for Xamarin.Forms (Portable library):

  * Assuming you are using an implementation of *IObjectCryptEngine* similar to the *SimpleAesCryptEngine* shown above and this class exists in the platform-specific projects, you will need to add a line above the class definition like the one below to tell Xamarin.Forms that you will be looking for this implementation of IObjectCryptEngine via the *DependencyService.Get&lt;T&gt;()* method.  With the addition of this extra line, the *SimpleAesCryptEngine* class from above should work in all platforms supported by Xamarin.Forms.
```c#
[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency (typeof(SimpleAesCryptEngine))]
public class SimpleAesCryptEngine : IObjectCryptEngine {
...
```

  * Then, to get a handle to your crypt engine inside the Xamarin.Forms portable project (where most of your application code lives), you will need to do something like this.  The Xamarin.Forms *DependencyService* does not allow us to send in parameters in the constructor of the *IObjectCryptEngine*, so we will instead pass them via the *Initialize()* method.  Now you can use myCryptEngine in your portable code as shown in all of the examples above.
```c#
IObjectCryptEngine myCryptEngine = DependencyService.Get<IObjectCryptEngine> ();
myCryptEngine.Initialize (new Dictionary<string, object>() { { "CryptoKey", "MY SECRET PASSWORD" } });
``` 

  * Next, we need a way to get the path to our database file, and this path will probably vary with each platform.  So, we want a platform specific class that implements the *IDatabasePath* interface, that will return the path to our portable code.  The *IDatabasePath* interface only defines one method - *GetPath(string databaseName)*.  You pass in the name of your SQLite database file, and it gives you back the appropriate path to the file (the returned path includes the database file name at the end).  Here are two platform specific classes that implement *IDatabasePath*:
```c#
//Implementation of IDatabasePath for Xamarin.iOS
using System;
using Portable.Data.Sqlite;

[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency (typeof(DatabasePath))]
public class DatabasePath : IDatabasePath
{
	public DatabasePath () { }

	public string GetPath (string databaseName)
	{
		string documentsPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal); // Documents folder
		string libraryPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(documentsPath, "..", "Library"); // Library folder
		return System.IO.Path.Combine(libraryPath, databaseName);
	}
}

//Implementation of IDatabasePath for Xamarin.Android
using System;
using Portable.Data.Sqlite;

[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency (typeof(DatabasePath))]
public class DatabasePath : IDatabasePath
{
	public DatabasePath () { }

	public string GetPath (string databaseName)
	{
		string libraryPath = System.Environment.GetFolderPath(System.Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal);
		return System.IO.Path.Combine(libraryPath, databaseName);
	}
}
```

  * Now, we can get these platform specific database paths using the following code in the Portable code project:
```c#
string databasePath = DependencyService.Get<IDatabasePath>().GetPath("mydatabase.sqlite");
using (var myConnection = new SqliteAdoConnection(
	new SQLitePCL.SQLiteConnection(databasePath), myCryptEngine)) { 
	...
```

Except for those minor changes, all of the example code shown above should work properly in the shared/portable code section of your Xamarin.Forms application.
